        <p>Jackson’s Honest started as a mission to bring ancestral fats back to the snack food aisle by introducing the world’s first potato and tortilla chips made with 100% organic coconut oil. The company was founded by Jackson’s mom (a mother of four) in her kitchen in Crested Butte, Colorado as a way to bring the story of her son Jackson’s struggle with an extremely rare autoimmune disease (Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome) to a wider audience. Through a decade of intense trial and error, she and her husband Scott reverse engineered a low-inflammation ketogenic diet with an emphasis on coconut oil and other ancestral fats as a way to ameliorate some of Jackson’s more profound neuro-degenerative symptoms. Their discovery of this fat-centered, low inflammation diet changed the trajectory of his disease and their family’s life, spurring them to share his story, their journey, and these products with the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>Jackson passed away suddenly and unexpectedly on Sunday, Aug. 13 2017. He was an inspiration to all who knew him. His courage in the face of his extremely rare disease was exceeded only by his strength in managing and battling it. One of only seven diagnosed cases of his particular variant of Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome, Jackson's condition went undiagnosed for 12 years until the National Institute of Health was able to finally diagnose him in 2014. Jackson carried the burden of his disease as if it were a feather. Despite many physical hardships, he laughed often and easily and he smiled as if he didn't have a care in the world. Being a witness to that, being on the receiving end of those smiles and laughs - humbled all those who knew and loved him. He has left behind in his parents,' sisters' and brother's hearts an enduring spirit, an immeasurable fortitude and a profound sense of gratitude for having been able to love him. Although Jackson was unable to speak, he commanded a room and communicated precisely what his needs, wants, and feelings were to those around him.</p>

        <p>His ability to communicate with his eyes was one of his greatest strengths. He was quite pushy in expressing his desire through noises and eye gaze. For instance, he clearly looked at his food when he wanted to eat, the door when he wanted to leave and his Broncos logo when he wanted to watch a game.</p>

      <p>The highlight of his winter-aside from the Denver Broncos-was skiing with his family and the wonderful volunteers who work at the Adaptive Sports Center in Crested Butte, CO. In the summer, he loved to roam around Crested Butte in his wheelchair, take drives into the surrounding mountains, and play with his friends and family in the backyard. Over the past several years, Jackson spent his school years in Boulder, CO, while his family sought ongoing medical care at Children's Hospital Colorado for his rare disease.</p>

        <p>Jackson's years in middle and high school were an incredibly rewarding experience for him. Participating in football and basketball, homecoming dances, and spending time with his many school friends enriched his life in so many ways. Many times we caught glimpses of Jackson's school life and the lives he touched in some way: maybe through his smile or his laugh, maybe because he was a good listener or maybe because he came along and had a great time when kids were ditching school to grab pizza (yes, that happened more times than we knew about).</p>

      <p style="text-align: center">His legacy lives on in the company, the mission, and the movement of Jackson's Honest Chips that his struggle founded. One day the joy and privilege of having him in our lives will surpass the pain of having lost him too early.</p>
